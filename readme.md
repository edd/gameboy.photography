Abandoned due to disuse. I'd recommend buying a [BitBoy](http://www.gameboyphoto.com/gameboyphoto/gameboy.html) nowadays, which emulates the [Game Boy Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer) and saves .BMP files out to an SD card. Much more practical for photographers on the go.

The code hasn't been touched much in *at least* 6 years. The nice thing about that is hey: it still works.
